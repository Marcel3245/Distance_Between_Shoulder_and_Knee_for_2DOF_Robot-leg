# Distance_Between_Shoulder_and_Knee_for_2DOF_Robot-leg
This MATLAB code is tailored for a two-link robot leg, specifically to calculate the horizontal distance between the knee and shoulder joints, based on the height from the shoulder to the foot in a standing position. By inputting the height, the code computes the optimal spacing to ensure proper posture and stability of the robot leg.
